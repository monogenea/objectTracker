# Detection and tracking in Python

Part of the tutorial from my blog [poissonisfish](https://TODO.com).

## Instructions

### Set up virtualenv

Install packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Video conversion

Use `ffmpeg` command line utilities to decrease the video resolution and remove the audio channel. Save as mp4.

### Run script

Observe the computations in real-time, while writing the new video.
