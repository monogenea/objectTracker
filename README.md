# Detection and tracking in Python

Part of the tutorial from my blog [poissonisfish](https://TODO.com).

## Instructions

### Set up virtualenv

Install packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Video conversion using the init Bash script

Run `./init.sh <PATH_TO_MOV>`. This will set up the working directory, convert the MOV video to MP4 and download the YOLOv3 dependencies for OpenCV.

### Run script

Observe the computations in real-time, while writing the new video.
